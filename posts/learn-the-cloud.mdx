# TLDR

Learn how to deploy your apps to the cloud, you're gonna need to eventually.

# The college experience

It wasn't until my junior or senior year in college that I had actually deployed a website. Going into my first job, the only two things I had really done with the cloud had been deploying a basic MEAN app to an AWS EC2 instance by following a tutorial online and launching my first profile website to github pages. Now that I'm professionally developing websites, it's a necessity that I know how to get updates live.

# Action Step

If you're learning to program and you've never hosted a live website, you should learn how to do it. There are now many platforms you can do this on including DigitalOcean, Vercel, Azure, and AWS, etc. Once you have a local site that you'd be happy with live, pick a platform, learn how to deploy the site, and launch that sucker. Most of these platforms offer free stuff, so you shouldn't have to pay for the hosting, at least at first.

Getting your app deployed boosts your morale, because you get to see the results of your hard work, and you know others can see and use it too now.
