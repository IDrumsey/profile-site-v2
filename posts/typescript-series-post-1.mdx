Typescript is a superset of javascript. It turns javascript into a statically typed language, which basically means you as a developer can define what types variables can be.

```js title="Example:"
let someVar // can be anything... a string, a number, an object, whatever
```

```ts
let someVar: string // now someVar can only be assigned a value that's a string

someVar = "abcd" // valid

someVar = 123 // invalid. won't work
```

<br />
<br />

Ok, so that's what it does, but how does this help us?

1. The main reason I like typescript so much is because it gives you good intellisense when writing code. Instead of having to just remember what kind of data a variable is supposed to have, you can just rely on typescript screaming at you when you assign the wrong type of value.

<br />
<br />

Here's some more examples.

```ts
type User = {
  id: number
  firstName: string
  lastName: string
  socialLinks?: {
    githubProfile: string
    twitterProfile: string
  }
}

const users: User[] = [
  {
    id: 1,
    firstName: Joe,
    lastName: Briggs,
    socialLinks: {
      githubProfile: ...
    }
  },

  {
    id: 2,
    firstName: Jamie,
    lastName: Riles
  }
]

function fetchUserById(id: number): User | undefined {

  return users.find(user => user.id == id)

}
```
